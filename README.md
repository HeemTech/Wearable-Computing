Wearable Computing - Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability to collect,work with, and clean data sets.

The following files are present in the repository:
1. run_analysis.R - the source code for running the analysis
2. README.md - this very file
3. CodeBook.md - a code book, describing the variavles, the data, and any transformation or work done to clean the data
4. Tidy_Data.txt - the tidy data generated after running the run_analysis.R

Run the code run_analysis.R. It will automatically load the required data sets, subset the required variables, and clean them.

The tidy data will be generated and stored automatically in a file named Tidy_Data.txt. It coltains 180 observations and 68 variables.
